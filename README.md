Web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a user-friendly experience for creating and generating secure, customizable passwords additionally assessing the strength and security in real-time. 


Features:
---------------------------------

Real-time Password Strength Feedback: As you type, the application instantly assesses your password's strength, providing visual feedback via a dynamic strength bar.

Detailed Requirement Checklist: A clear checklist indicates whether your password meets common security criteria:

[
Minimum length: (8 characters)
Inclusion of uppercase: letters
Inclusion of lowercase: letters
Inclusion of numbers: numbers
Inclusion of special: symbols
]

- Contextual Suggestions: Receive instant feedback and suggestions for improving your password's strength   
  if it falls short of recommended criteria.

Final Thoughts & Future Enhancements
---------------------------------
Creating this Password Strength Checker and Generator has been a rewarding experience and has allowed me to deeply engage in frontt-end web development and additionally apply the principles of cybersecurity while focusing on user-centric design (which I greatly enjoy).

This project displays my ability to build real world, practical tools and address security needs. 


Future Enhancements Planned:
---------------------------------
- Integration with more advanced password entropy algorithms for even more precise strength assessment.

- Adding features for password history management (stored locally for user convenience).

- Exploring responsive design improvements for seamless experience across various devices.

- Implementing a "passwordless" authentication simulation to delve deeper into alternative security methods 
  (tying into my interest in AI/Cybersecurity).
